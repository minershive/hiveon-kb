## Billing Updates

**PAGE UNDER UPDATE!**

**Changes in Billing since January 13, 2020**

Valid from January 20, 2020 00:00 UTC

- The number of free rigs is now increased to 4
- Now you can pay for Hive OS through mining ETH on Hiveon pool
- A new interval for billing calculation

### Here are the basic things you need to know:
1. There are no changes for paid users apart from an extra opportunity to pay for Hive OS at the cost of 3% dev fee (for mining Ethereum on Hiveon pool).

2. Free users get an additional 4th rig. Free usage of service is available when meeting certain rules:
- 1 rig under any condition
- 2-4 rigs are free on certain* conditions
- 5 and more rigs are paid

<pre><code>
Mining ETH on Hiveon pool — 4 rigs are free.
Mining not ETH — 4 rigs are free.
Mining on NiceHash, Comining, MRR — 4 rigs are free.
Mining ETH not on Hiveon pool — 1 rig is free, others are paid.
</code></pre>
2-4 rigs, one is mining ЕТН on any pool, and others mine other coins — 4 rigs are free.

These rules come into force on 20 January 2020. The 4th additional rig is already available.

- free rigs are those rigs which mine either ETH coin on Hiveon pool, or not ETH on any other pools. “Not-ETH” coins also include coins on the Ethash algorithm (ETC, PIRL, CLO and others) and services NiceHash, Comining, MRR, MPH.

Tarification is calculated with a 5-minute interval. Paid users who can mine for example only at a preferential (night) tariff for electricity, will pay less per day, in proportion to the operating time of their farms.

Please, carefully learn all the details of the updates <a href="https://medium.com/hiveon/hiveon-pool-important-updates-cd4f1be00f0a">here</a>.

### And now we will answer several important questions:
**When can I have 4 free rigs?**

4 free rigs are available if you:
- mine Ethereum on Hiveon Pool;
- mine other coins.

Mining Ethereum on other pools involves paying $3/month for each rig, starting from 2nd rig.

**When will I be able to pay for Hive OS on Hiveon Pool (with a 3% dev fee)?**

From 20 January 2020.

**How to move to Hiveon Pool?**

You need to create a Flight Sheet using Hiveon Pool and apply it to workers.

**Will ASIC users (not firmware) also have 4 free workers?**

Yes, for ASIC users of Hive OS the number of free workers has also increased from 3 to 4.

**How will the billing changes enter into force?**

You can use 4 workers for Free instead of 3 from 13 January 2020. Mining Ethereum on other pools (up to 4 workers) is free till 19 January 2020 inclusively. From 20 January 2020, you will have to pay for mining Ethereum NOT on Hiveon Pool: $3/month per worker in Hive OS, starting from 2nd rig.

For free users, there will be no dev fee on Hiveon Pool.

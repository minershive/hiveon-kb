## Billing Updates

**PAGE UNDER UPDATE!**

**Changes in Billing since January 13, 2020**

## Breaking billing news! Take a closer look to miss nothing.
From now on:

### Pay per 5 minutes, not per day!
Billing is calculated with a 5-minute interval and those users who can mine for example only at a preferential (night) tariff for electricity, while having 5 or more rigs, will pay less per day. If your worker was functioning for only 1 hour, you will pay for 1 hour, not for an entire day.

### 4 free rigs rather than 3.
Hive OS is free for 4 rigs from today! They are free to use until you have more. If you add the 5th rig your farm will be charged for 5. You can have multiple farms, if the total number of workers stays within 4 rigs, it would be free. If you have 5 farms with 1 worker in each, then all 5 will be billed.
>_1 Rig for Free on any conditions and 2-4 rigs for Free with some conditions (read forward)._

### Pay for Hive OS on Hiveon Pool.
Now let’s check important Hiveon Pool updates for paid and free Hive OS users.


## PAID USERS
For paid users, you can use Hive OS at the expense of a commission of 3% of Ethereum mining on the Hiveon pool.

So, you can choose between two options: to pay for Hive OS on Hiveon Pool (3% dev fee) while mining Ethereum, or pay $3/month per rig as usual.

You can switch to payment on Hiveon pool while creating a new farm or in the farm settings (see the screen below):

_in farm settings_

**Payment on Hiveon pool is set on default, but you can switch to the payment in Hive OS at any time.**

Regardless of the chosen alternative, you can get a discount depending on the number of rigs. See the details below:

## FREE USERS
Free users get an additional 4th rig for free. Rig that will mine Ethereum on the Hiveon pool OR any other coins on any other pools will be considered free. Other coins including any other coins based on the Ethash algorithm (for example, Ethereum Classic), as well as services such as NiceHash, Comining, MRR, MiningPoolHub.

<pre><code>
1 Rig for Free without restrictions.
2 to 4 rigs: Free with restrictions (see the image below)
5 or more: paid.
</code></pre>

More details below:

### FARM BALANCE EXPLANATIONS
In the farm balance you will see the following table:

<img class="ny pt eq t u ho ak hx" width="1121" height="541" role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2242/0*IJyyUA8TwWiBszHa">

Let us explain what the amount column is.

So, every rig, if working with no interruptions for the whole day, reaches the rate **1**. If the rig was switched between the pools, the rate would be divided accordingly: for example, **0.4** and **0.6**.

In case the rig was working only half of the day, the total rate is **0.5**, while the divided ones will be (according to the example above) **0.2** and **0.3**. In the amount column, you can see the sum of all the rigs’ rates for specific pools.

**If you mine Ethereum on Hiveon, you have to restart your miner to move to the new billing system.**

**Mining Ethereum on another pool (up to 4 workers) is free until 19.01 inclusive, from 20.01 Ethereum mining on another pool will be charged $3/month for each worker on Hive OS (*except one free rig).**

***Attempts to cheat with the system will be billed to the full extent and can lead to the ban.***

### And now we will answer several important questions:
**When can I have 4 free rigs?**

4 free rigs are available if you:
- mine Ethereum on Hiveon Pool;
- mine other coins.

Mining Ethereum on other pools involves paying $3/month for each rig, starting from 2nd rig.

**When will I be able to pay for Hive OS on Hiveon Pool (with a 3% dev fee)?**

From 20 January 2020.

**How to move to Hiveon Pool?**

You need to create a Flight Sheet using Hiveon Pool and apply it to workers.

**Will ASIC users (not firmware) also have 4 free workers?**

Yes, for ASIC users of Hive OS the number of free workers has also increased from 3 to 4.

**How will the billing changes enter into force?**

You can use 4 workers for Free instead of 3 from 13 January 2020. Mining Ethereum on other pools (up to 4 workers) is free till 19 January 2020 inclusively. From 20 January 2020, you will have to pay for mining Ethereum NOT on Hiveon Pool: $3/month per worker in Hive OS, starting from 2nd rig.

For free users, there will be no dev fee on Hiveon Pool.

**If I’m mining ETH on Hiveon pool & CPU mining on other pool on the same rigs that mining ETH what would be the charges on me?**

We don’t charge any fee for CPU mining in this case.

**Hiveon pool. What’s interesting?**

Pool web site: <a href="https://www.hiveon.net/">hiveon.net</a>

Mining Reward Type: PPS+ (miners are paid by the pool for each valid share that they submit to the pool). Servers in the EU and North America. The hardware has been replaced with a more powerful one. In the near future, we will add more settings, statistics to the pool and the pool will be closely integrated with Hive OS.

So, now you are familiar with the updates and ready for the changes! However, if you still have any questions, we are always ready to answer them: just <a href="https://t.me/hiveon_en">get in touch</a> with us.

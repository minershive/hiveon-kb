### How does Hive's billing system work?
Hive OS is a prepaid system. You need to make a deposit to have more than 4 free workers in your farm. Deposit can be as small as you wish. There's no need to prepay for the whole month, you can pay $1, for example, just to give Hive OS a try.

**<a href="https://hiveos.farm/faq-billing-billing-updates">Here</a>** you can learn more about new billing conditions.

### Can I get a discount?
Yes, all discount plans can be viewed on the <a href="https://hiveos.farm/pricing/">pricing page</a>.

Discounts apply for the total number of workers in the farms you own. For example, **Farm1** has 40 and **Farm2** has 20 workers, the discount will be calculated based on the total of 60 workers.

ASICs have a different base price and are cheaper than rigs because there are not as many functions compared to rigs. Workers with <a href="https://hiveos.farm/asic">Hiveon ASIC Firmware</a> are not charged and can use Hive OS for free.

### How do I deposit funds?
Hive accepts cryptos only. Our payment provider is <a href="https://www.coinpayments.net/">CoinPayments</a>.

Refunds or withdrawals are not available. You can transfer funds only between users and farms, but there is no withdrawal option.

If you have referral earnings you can deposit them to a Hive account. Referral rewards are paid out once a month to your address if you have one specified.

### Can I pay using a different payment system like PayPal instead of paying with cryptocurrency?
Not at the moment. Payment is currently done only using cryptocurrency through the <a href="https://www.coinpayments.net/">CoinPayments</a> service.

### What is CoinPayments?
It's an integrated payment system for cryptocurrencies that can be used to pay for our services. More details are available <a href="https://www.coinpayments.net/">here</a>.

### How quickly after payment does the money appear in the account?
Everything depends on the processing speed of CoinPayments service. We have no control over the transaction period.

### What happens when there's zero credit on my account? Will mining stop?
No, your workers will continue mining for some time, but the ability to monitor your stats through Hive OS server will be unavailable.

### How does the Credit work?
Credit can be given for up to 5 days. When your farm's balance reaches 0 (zero), it will have a negative balance, but your workers will still work. After 5 days the farm will be locked. A negative balance will be covered automatically after you make a new deposit.

### User and Farm balance
For more convenient money management, farms have their own balances. You can make a direct deposit to your account and then refill the farms you own. If a farm balance is 0 (zero) then the user’s balance will be charged. This way you don't need to refill your farm's balance directly.

### What are the Paid Features?
There is a button in your billing page where you can enable Paid Features. The full list of features is available <a href="https://hiveos.farm/pricing/">here</a>. There are SSL worker connections, monthly stats, etc. This list is subject to changes and is growing with more features being implemented.

### Can I transfer the responsibility of farm billing?
By default owner of the farm is responsible for billing. When the farm’s balance is low the funds will be deducted from user’s balance. Optionally the owner can transfer billing rights to other users, let’s say an accountant. Other users will need to confirm that they accept the billing responsibility upon transfer. The common case of using this feature would be to set one of your organization members to be responsible for topping-up the balances of farms and not giving them any other extra management rights. You will remain as the owner.

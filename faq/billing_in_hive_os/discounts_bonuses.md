# Discounts and Bonuses: How to Pay Less

>Please note, that all current discount plans can be viewed on the <a href="https://hiveos.farm/pricing/">pricing page</a>.

### Discounts for the number of Workers
If you have a large number of workers, you can count on a discount from us. This is how it works:

| Number of workers | Discount |
|-------------------|----------|
|50+               | 10%      |
|100+              | 20%      |
|250+               | 30%      |
| 500+              | 40%      |
| 1000+             | 50%      |


Discounts apply for the total number of workers in the farms you own. For example, **Farm1** has 40 and **Farm2** has 20 workers, the discount will be calculated based on the total of 60 workers.

### A 30% bonus for a deposit
To receive it, you have to meet the following two requirements:

- First of all, you have to be the owner of the account and use paid Hive OS features for 2 weeks.

- After these 2 weeks, you have to deposit 3 months worth of funds to your account. Then you will receive 30% of the deposited amount.

There is no need for you to calculate the deposit amount yourself. In case you are eligible to get the bonus, you will see the minimum amount in the “Your Funds” tab (feel free to pay more, but the minimum amount is required). After this, you can just deposit the money and enjoy your 30% bonus.

__Please note, that you can’t make a deposit in several payments — everything must be done in one payment. Apart from this, keep in mind the Coinpayments fee.__

### A 3% bonus for a deposit in Stablecoins
Being a Hive OS user means that you get a 3% bonus for any amount of replenishment using stablecoins. We accept the following stablecoins:
- USDT
- TUSD
- USDC

### A discount for using Hiveon ASIC Firmware
ASICs with <a href="https://hiveos.farm/asic">Hiveon ASIC Firmware</a> are not charged and can use Hive OS for free.

### Paying for Hive OS on Hiveon Pool
Paid users can now use Hive OS at the expense of a commission of 3% for Ethereum mining on the Hiveon pool. The number of rigs is also considered - you will pay less in case you have a lot of them.


| Number of rigs | Discount | Dev Fee|
|-------------------|----------|--------|
|50+               | 10%        |2.7%|
|100+              | 20%      |2.4%|
|250+               | 30%      |2.1%|
| 500+              | 40%      |1.8%|
| 1000+             | 50%      |1.5%|

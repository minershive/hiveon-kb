Paying for Hive OS is a very simple procedure. Just follow this instruction:

1. Log into your account and go to the **Your funds** tab. If you are logged into the farm, then you will need the **Billing** tab.

2. In the **Personal address deposit** tab, select the provider (Hive).
3. Now select a coin from the dropdown list.
4. Click the **Add** button. At the bottom, you will see a personal deposit address.
5. Transfer funds to this address.
If these types of coins do not suit you, you can choose another payment provider Coinpayments, and also create a personal address and transfer funds to it. Do not forget to take into account that each exchange has a different percentage for withdrawing funds, so there may be a slight difference between the amount sent and received.

Apart from ETH, you can also pay for Hive OS with Stablecoins (TUSD, USDC, USDT). Please note that TUSD and USDT are not the same coins!

Remember that you can also pay for Hive OS on Hiveon Pool (3% dev fee) while mining Ethereum or Ethereum Classic. If you have more than 50 devices, you will get a discount. You can switch to this payment method using the slider button - it is located right below the window for entering the payment amount. On the second screen, the slider is set to the Hiveon Pool Charging Disabled position, which means that payment from the mining commission on the pool is not turned on.

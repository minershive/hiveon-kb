## Referral Rewards System: How to earn with Hive OS

Apart from mining, you can also earn from your referral payments! To start earning, follow this guide:

1. [Sign up](https://the.hiveos.farm/register/) and get a referral link with your account ID.

2. Share it on social networks, forums or blogs.

3. New users that sign-up using your referral link will be marked as your referrals.

### Referrals who use only Hive OS
If a referral **makes a deposit** and **add miners**, you will receive **10%** of their daily payment. For example, a referral pays $3 today — you receive $0.3. In case a referral makes a deposit but adds no miners, the rewards system won’t work.

>**A referral reward is counted ONLY when a referral pays for using Hive OS**.

### Referrals who mine on Hiveon pool
If such referrals have more than 4 rigs and pay 3% (or less with the discount based on the [number of workers](https://hiveos.farm/faq-billing_in_hive_os-discounts_bonuses)) for Hive OS on Hiveon pool, you will receive **10%** of the 3% fee that they pay.

You can also create promo codes for new users to receive on their accounts.

Payments are usually done at the end of the month, in case the amount has reached the equivalent of $25. The payment is sent to the specified private wallet.

This means that you can earn even without using Hive! Just create an account, attract referrals and earn your 10%.

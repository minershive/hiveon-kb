# What is Hive OS?
Hive OS is an operating system based on the Linux distribution of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, whose main task is to provide the user with a convenient interface for mining crypto-currency on GPU rigs and ASIC miners while managing them by using a web interface.

# Is Hive OS free?
It is a conditionally free operating system. If you use up to 3 workers — it is free. Starting from 4 rigs you pay the monthly fee for all workers.

ASICs using <a href="https://hiveos.farm/asic">Hiveon ASIC Firmware</a> are not charged by our billing system and can use Hive OS for free.

# What is a worker?
A worker is a term used to describe both types of mining hardware that is supported by Hive OS: a rig — a computer built with GPUs; and ASIC — an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) customized for cryptocurrency mining.

title: Farm Hash
category: Guides
meta_description: Using the Farm Hash value you can quickly and easily add rigs to your farm in Hive OS.
---

You can find FARM_HASH on the web. Using it you can easily add rigs in bulk without creating rigs on the web and getting RIG_ID. Hash is unique for each farm.

Write Hive image as usual to your Flash/SSD. After the write you’ll find HIVE disk in Windows. It holds Hive config files, there is `rig-config-example.txt` in there. Open it, edit and save as `rig.conf`.
<pre><code>
HIVE_HOST_URL="https://api.hiveos.farm"

# Find out your hash in farm's settings on the web
# The rig will autoregister itself in your account after the first run
FARM_HASH=<your farm hash goes here>

# Password used for the rig
RIG_PASSWD=

# If you know rig id before creation you can set it here leaving FARM_HASH blank
RIG_ID=

# If you use FARM_HASH you can optionally name your rig otherwise the name will be autogenerated
WORKER_NAME=

...........
</code></pre>
Put your Farm Hash, copy the value from the web: `FARM_HASH=f019745da6ba65630b28ef3c92608e7022b4bf76`
No need to set RIG_ID or RIG_PASSWD.

That’s it, just to set the value in `rig.conf`. Now boot your rig and it will connect to web automatically.

FARM_HASH can be effectively used with Hive Flasher for bulk rig installations. More details [here](https://github.com/minershive/hive-flasher).

ASICs can be installed in bulk just by connecting via SSH and using FARM_HASH. More details [here](https://github.com/minershive/hiveos-asic).

# How to Start Mining on Hiveon Pool
Are you going to start mining on Hiveon pool? Great! To make your life easier, we prepared a guide on how to switch to Hiveon pool, for both Hive OS and Windows users. Keep reading to discover more.

## If you are a Hive OS user
### Step 1: Create a Wallet
To start mining Ethereum on Hiveon pool, you should first create a wallet. To do this, log in to the system, go to the **Wallets** tab and click the **Add Wallet** button. You will have to specify the coin (ETH), the address, the name and the source.

  />

When you are done, click the **Create** button. And your wallet is ready!

### Step 2: Create a Flight Sheet
To create a Flight Sheet, go to the **Flight Sheets** tab. You will see the following:

  />

Now it is time to fill the fields:

- Coin: choose ETH
- Wallet: choose your Ethereum wallet
- Pool: choose Hiveon from the dropdown list
- Miner: choose your preferred miner
- Name: enter the name for your Flight Sheet (that’s optional)
- Click the **Create Flight Sheet** button

  />

### Step 3: Apply the Flight Sheet to your worker

There are two ways to do this:

**Option 1**: Go to the **Workers** tab, choose a specific worker, and then go to the **Flight Sheets** tab in the rig’s menu. Click the rocket icon in the top right corner.

  />

**Option 2**: Go to the **Workers** tab and mark the check boxes on the left side of the chosen rigs. Again, you should click the rocket icon.

After you click the rocket, you will see a window with the number of your chosen workers and a full list of your Flight Sheets. Choose the created Flight Sheet and click the **Apply** button. Then you will see a message saying that the command was sent to the worker (or workers). In a few seconds, your rigs will apply the changes, and you will see the Config message in the activity logs:

<img
  src="https://github.com/minershive/hiveon-kb/raw/master/images\hiveon-pool\hiveonpool5.png?sanitize=true" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/minershive/hiveon-kb/raw/master/images\hiveon-pool\hiveonpool5.png"
  />

Now everything is ready! Your rig will start mining and sending data to the dashboard. You will be able to follow its performance in real time.

## If you are a Windows user
In case you mine on Windows without using Hive OS, you should follow these steps:

### Step 1: Get a package file

We have prepared a set of [package files](http://download.hiveos.farm/hiveon/) for the most popular miners: Claymore's ETH Miner, PhoenixMiner and ETHminer. Choose the package file for your miner and copy it to the folder with the miner.

### Step 2: Open the file
Open the file with a text editor (Notepad++) and write your data there:

- Your wallet instead of `PUT_YOUR_WALLET_HERE`.

- If necessary, enter the name of your worker in `WORKER_NAME`.

- Enter the location (yours or the closest one) in `POOL_URL - RU, EU, NAW`

Now save the file, launch it and start using Hiveon pool. Happy mining!

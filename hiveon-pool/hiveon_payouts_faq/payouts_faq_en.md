# What is Hiveon.net's payout type?
Hiveon.net works based on the PPS+ model of payouts.

# Are there payouts for stale shares?
Yes, payment for stale shares is made, but using the coefficient of 0.6-0.8, depending on network delays.

> _Starting from today, we are changing the rules for stale shares payouts. For **up to 6%** of stale shares, the conditions are the same. Starting from **6% and above**, the pool freezes the payouts, meaning you won't get paid for your stale shares. If the problem of high stales persists for 48 hours, the wallet is blacklisted and payouts are frozen until further notice._

> _Such radical measures are related to the fact that fraudulent miners abuse our stale shares payout system. Thank you for understanding and thank you for using our ecosystem._

# How to reduce stale shares?
It should be noted that the number of Stale Shares mainly depends on the quality of connection between your miners and the pool servers. Also to a large extent it depends on the quality of work of network equipment between the network nodes. Please make sure your stale shares stay below 5%. The payout coefficient for the stale shares will be 0.6-0.8 of the price for an accepted share.

Unfortunately, the pool's technical staff is not able to affect the quality of your provider's equipment and the routing of network packets from you to the pool and back. If you are absolutely confident in the quality of your own network equipment and if you are an honest miner, but regularly get blocked payouts, in this case - we are very sorry, but there's nothing we can do. It should also be noted that if you work through a mobile operator (3G / 4G modems or Wi-Fi routers), then the probability of a large number of stale shares is high due to the peculiarities of the mobile connectivity.

# Why is a large amount of stale shares bad?
For regular pools, where stales are not paid for, only the miner himself is at a loss if there's a large number of stales, because he simply loses income. Stale shares is lost profit. In the case when stale shares are payed out (as is the case on our pool), it lowers the pool's luck, because stales don't participate in finding a block, thus they'll have to be payed out at the expense of internal means of the Hive ecosystem.

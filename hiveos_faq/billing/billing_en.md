# How is the monthly fee charged?
The subscription system will charge once a day based on the number of paid workers in your account.

# Can I get a discount?
Yes, all discount plans can be viewed on the [pricing page](https://hiveos.farm/pricing/).


# Can I pay using a different payment system like PayPal instead of paying with cryptocurrency?
Not at the moment. Payment is currently done only using cryptocurrency through the [CoinPayments](https://www.coinpayments.net/) service.

# Can I pay Hive directly and not via CoinPayments?
No. The billing system was not designed to work that way.

# How quickly after payment, does the money appear in an account?
It all depends on the processing speed of CoinPayments service. We have no control over the transaction period.

# What is CoinPayments?
It's an integrated payment system for cryptocurrencies that can be used to pay for our services. More detail are available [here](https://www.coinpayments.net/).

# I dislike the CoinPayments service, can I pay using a different payment method?
Currently payments can only be done using cryptocurrency and only through [CoinPayments](https://www.coinpayments.net/) service.

# I payed my monthly subscription, but received a message "Waiting for confirms… (0.00241/0.00253 received with 1 confirms)" in my payment status, what did I do wrong?
You have payed without including a fee. There are 2 ways to deal with this:

1. You leave this payment as is, the money will be returned within 24 hours from the time the transaction was made. You can create another payment bill, but this time including the tax fee.
2. You can make another transaction to cover missing the missing amount (0.00253-0.00241). But you could have minimal withdraw restrictions on your exchange. You should refer to your payment system documentation for more details.

# I have paid more than the subscription bill, can I receive the rest of the funds on my Hive OS account?
This is not possible. You are not paying to Hive account directly but to CoinPayments instead. For example, if you had issued the bill for $15, but sent more than that, then only $15 will be transferred as payment to your Hive account. The rest of the funds will return. If you don't receive the rest of your funds back, you should contact CoinPayments. But we suggest waiting at least 24 hours for your refund first, before contacting CoinPayments support.

# My rigs weren't working the whole day, can I expect a discount proportionate to all that time?
The billing system charges per day of use, regardless of hours. If your worker was not online during the day, the payment will not be charged.

# What happens when there's zero credits on my account? Will mining stop?
No, your workers will continue mining for some time, but the ability to monitor your stats through Hive OS server will be unavailable.
